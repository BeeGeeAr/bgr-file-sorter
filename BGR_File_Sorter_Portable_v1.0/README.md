# 🗂️ BGR File Sorter

**BGR File Sorter** is a lightweight, silent background utility that automatically organizes files in one or more source folders based on their file type. No more cluttered `Downloads` folders!

## 🚀 Features

- 📂 Sorts files by extension into categorized subfolders
- 🔍 Supports multiple source folders (defined in `sources.txt`)
- 🔧 Customizable file-type mappings (`file_types.json`)
- 📊 Logs all activity into `sort_log.csv`
- 🖥️ Compiled `.exe` available — no need for Python!
- 🧘 Silent mode — runs in the background without interrupting you

---

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Monitor** your configured folders for new files
2. **Detect** the file extension
3. **Move** the file to the appropriate subfolder (e.g., Excel Files, PDFs, Images, etc.)
4. **Log** the action (timestamp, original location, new location, status)

## 📁 File Structure

```text
📁 BGR_File_Sorter_Portable_v1.0/
├── bgr_file_sorter.exe ← Executable file (silent, background)
├── file_types.json ← File type to folder mapping
├── sources.txt ← List of folders to watch
├── sort_log.csv ← Log file (autogenerated)
└── README.md ← You're reading it!
```

## 🧩 Configuration

### ✅ `sources.txt`

List one folder path per line. These will be monitored.

`C:\Users\YourName\Downloads`

### ✅ `file_types.json`

Define where each file type should go:

```json
{
  ".xlsx": "Excel Files",
  ".pdf": "PDFs",
  ".png": "Images",
  ".mp4": "Video"
}
You can add/edit file types here anytime — no need to restart the app.

⚙️ How to Run
📦 Portable mode: Just double-click bgr_file_sorter.exe

🐍 Python mode: Run bgr_file_sorter.py (requires watchdog package)

🧼 Log Output
Everything the sorter does is recorded in sort_log.csv:

| Timestamp           | File Name    | From Path        | To Path                       | Status |
|---------------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------------------|--------|
| 2025-06-17 14:32:01 | receipt.pdf  | C:\Downloads     | C:\Downloads\PDFs\receipt.pdf | Moved  |


🛑 Stop the App
If running via .exe: close from Task Manager or reboot

If running via terminal: press Ctrl + C

📌 Notes
Folder mappings are relative to the source folder

Missing folders are automatically skipped and logged

File overwrites are handled safely (skipped if file already exists)
